# schema-matching-benchmark
Starting Project to make a benchmark on WDC dataset using different schema alignment software. This code is developed to filter, trasform and adapt the WCD dataset.

With the usage of the input_reduce the dataset is reduced about 95% (~20GB to ~1GB). This Huge reduction is due to a lot of no valid SchemaInformation.

Next Step we will provide a SchemaMaker based on the filtered Dataset.
